The function is a special type of object. Only functions have the prototype property.
It has an invaluable piece of code, an optional name property, its own properties and we can use **proto** link up to the prototype.

<!-- Function has Code, Name(optional), Properties, and Prototype( :{__proto__, …} ). -->
