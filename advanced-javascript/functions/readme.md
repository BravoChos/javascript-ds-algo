# Function

The function is a special type of object.
It has an piece of written code, an optional name property, arguments, and its own properties, and we can use `__proto__` link up to the prototype.

`**Only functions have the prototype property.**`

It can pass them around like objects, and allows us to store them as data as well.

When we define our functions and the compiler looks at our code lexically. And it determines what variables are available for us in our variable environment. And it also add our scope chains.
