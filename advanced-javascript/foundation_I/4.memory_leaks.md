# Memory Leak

Memory leaks are pieces of memory that the application has used in the past, but is not needed any longer, but has not yet been returned back to us to the pool of free memory.

There are three common memory leaks to remember.

1. `Global variables`.

We don't want to have too many global variables and objects. Hypothetically if we just keep adding variables to my environment, we're adding more and more pieces of memory.

2. `Event Listeners`.

This is one of the most common ways to leak memory. For example, if you keep adding event listeners and you never remove them even when you don't need them, this will cause a memory leak, because they're just there in the background.

3. `Creating a memory`.

This happens a lot in single-page applications (SPA). As a developer, if you forgot to remove an event listener whenever a component unmounts, then memory will likely keep increasing as more event listeners are being added. (ex. setInterval)
