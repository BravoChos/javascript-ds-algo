# Lexical Environment

**The lexical environment is simply where you write something.** **'Lexical'** means a compile-time, where the code is written.Â It's checking to see where the codes were written and their location. Remember how our JavaScript engine works. It looks through our code and then reads through our code, and so where we write something is important.

The compiler, knowing where it was written, can decide and make decisions as to where to put things and what actions to take, and what function has access to in that world.

> In JavaScript, our lexical scope, which is available data and variables where the function was defined, determines our available variables. Not where the function is called (`dynamic scope`).

To review, execution context tells you which lexical environment is currently running. The very first lexical environment is the global lexical environment, where we write our code.
