# Execution Context

When code is running on the JavaScript engine, a global execution context,
which gives us the global object and 'this' keyword underneath the hood, is created.
So whenever our code is running in JavaScript, it is run ning inside of an `execution context`.

On top of that, when you run a function, a new execution context is added.
And we start running our code until everything gets popped up the stack and all of our code is run.
