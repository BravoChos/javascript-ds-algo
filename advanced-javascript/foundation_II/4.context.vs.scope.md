# Context vs Scope

**_Scope_** is a 'function' based, and it means what variables are accessible when a function is invoked (or what variable environment is).

**_Context_**, on the other hand, is more about 'object' based, and context let us know the value of the this keyword, which is a reference to the object that owns that current executing code.

## Summary

Context is most often determined by how a function is invoked with the value of 'this' keyword, and scope refers to the visibility of variables.
