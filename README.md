**About this Repository**

I always wanted to land a job at a great tech company like Google, Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, or other companies but alway got "stuck" on coding interview.
So I create a new repository to develop my knowledge about algorithms, data structures and the notorious Big-O Notation. All the solutions are written in Javascript only.

I hope this work would help me boost my coding skills in the end, and if possible, hope that this documentation may help you too.

Happy Coding!
