# Stack

Stack is a type of data structure like a plate. That is, we have one piece of data and then another piece of data comes along and gets stacked on top of that piece of data.
These plates stacked on top of each other vertically and you can only touch the top plate.Â 

The way we can access data from a stack is to grab the first plate, then the second plate, then the third, and keep going until we've gone through all the stack. This is called LIFO (or last-in, first-out) because the last item that comes in is the first one that comes out.

## Use Cases

Stacks are very important in language-specific engines such as Javascript. Most programming languages are modeled with the stack architecture in mind, and when functions get called in a programming language, usually they follow this model of LIFO.

Another useful way of using Stacks is browser history. When we go back and forth from one website to another and then we hit the back button or the front button, that is when we are using Stacks.

Maybe you're writing a piece of text and you want to undo something so you can click the undo option to go back or forward to redo. The idea comes from Stacks that are used for the previous state over your work and memory in such an order that the last one appears first.

## Methods

Stacks usually come with three types of methods which are 'pop', 'push' and 'peek'.
