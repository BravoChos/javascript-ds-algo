# Queues

Queues are like an entrance to a roller coaster. The first person that arrives in line gets to go first on the rollercoaster and then the second person gets to go and then so and so forth. It's the opposite of Stacks(FIFO).

Any kind of waitlist apps such as Uber, Grab, and Lyft uses Queues to make reservations. The person that requested the ride first will get priority and then the next person get second.

The most common example of Queues is a printer. The person that clicks print first should have their first printout and the same for the second person that goes next.

## Methods
Queues usually come with four types of methods which are 'lookup', 'enqueue', 'dequeue', and 'peek'.

You can use push for 'enqueue', which means add to the queue, and 'dequeue', which is similar to pop, means remove a person from line. 

However, 'dequeue', unlike pop, doesn't take the last person in line. It takes the first person.

We also have 'peek', which once again tells us what's the first item that's going to come up that is the first person in the list. Big O notation is quite fast in Queues.

## Why not use an array to build a Queue? 

The answer is that it's very inefficient. Because we're removing the first item from the list, and if we shift something in the array, we have to remove the first item and then shift all those indexes.
