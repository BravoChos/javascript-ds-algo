# Stacks and Queues

Stacks and Queues are both **linear data structures**, and linear data structures allow us to traverse data elements sequentially one by one.Â 
The main difference between those two is only how items get removed from this data structure.

Unlike an array, in stacks, because there's no random access operation, we mainly use stacks and queues to run commands like 'push', 'peak', 'pop',
all of which deal exclusively with the element at the beginning or the end of the data structure.

## Why would we want this?

Stacks and Queues, which are using arrays or linked lists, except unlike arrays and linked lists, have fewer methods or less actions that we can perform on.
And sometimes it's good to have these higher-level data structures that are built on top of lower-level ones like linked lists and arrays to limit the operations.
In computer science. Having this limited ability on a data structure is an advantage because we can control that.
Whoever uses these data structures performs only the right operations that are efficient.
