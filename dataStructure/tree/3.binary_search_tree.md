# Binary Search Tree (BST)

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree in which each vertex has only up to 2 children that satisfies BST property: All vertices in the left subtree of a vertex must hold a value smaller than its own and all vertices in the right subtree of a vertex must hold a value larger than its own (we have assumption that all values are distinct integers in this visualization and small tweak is needed to cater for duplicates/non integer).

## Pros and Cons

The binary search tree has really good performance.

1. Better than O(n)
2. Ordered
3. Flexible Size

Most operations in a binary search tree are better than O(n) assuming that the binary search tree is balanced.Â  It is ordered.
And because we can place the node anywhere in memory, we can just have flexible sizes. We can keep growing our tree.

The downside is that,

1. No O(1) operations

it has no O(1) operation. we usually have to do some sort of traversal through the tree for any sort of operation.
So compared to an array, a lookup, for example, will be a lot faster. A good thing to keep in mind is that binary search trees aren't the fastest for anything. There are certain conditions where they do outperform objects and race.
