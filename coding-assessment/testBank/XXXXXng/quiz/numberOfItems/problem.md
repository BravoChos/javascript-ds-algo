**008. Number of Items (Easy)**

The program uses a data structure with an array that can contain items and other arrays. Write a function "numberOfItems" that recursively passes through all arrays and counts the nubmer of occurrences of a given item. Keep in mind that arrays can be nested within each other.

For example, "numberOfItems(arr,25)" and "numberOfItems(arr,"apple")" for the array below should both return 2. The

```
var arr = [25, "apple",["banana", "strawberry","apple",25]];
```
