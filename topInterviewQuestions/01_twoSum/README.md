**1. Two Sum (Easy)**

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example**

Example 1:

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

Constraints:

```
- 2 <= nums.length <= 103
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- -109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
```
